1. What is a Node module?

- A node module is code or set of functions you can use in your application. They allow your app to be modular and be contained for specific purposes that
the app can import and used when needed. They can be added or removed with ease.


2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

- Thae main difference is that module.exports can be reassigned to a specific object type. Reassigning export would not be available outside of the
module


3. Why is using exports recommended?

- Using exports is recommended because if we accidently reassigned module.exports, it would cause our functions to not work when called in the application.
